# Firebase AUTH Example #

To run it you'll need a Google Firebase account with an active project to give the connection
options into the file `public/javascripts/firebase.js` (`firebase.1.js` is an example/layout file)
to run this just run `npm run dev` into console at this project folder.

It is a simple github-firebase authentication example to demonstrate the usage.
